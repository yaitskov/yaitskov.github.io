title: About
---

I am a software engineer. My career started with
[PHP](https://www.php.net/) and JavaScript, but soon I was able to
switch to JVM stack and stayed with [Java](https://www.java.com/) for quite awhile.

Though for the last X years I have been working as a
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and
[PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) developer.

The most recent trend in my career is studying
[Roqc](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant, originally known as
Coq. I hope to generate more reliable Haskell code with the help of Roqc.
